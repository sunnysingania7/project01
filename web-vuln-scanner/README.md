# Web Vulnerablity Scanner - Poject01

Welcome to the Web Vulnerability Scanner - a hands-on cybersecutity project built with python and Flask. This scanner was crafted during my internship to deepen my understanding of web security and refine my full-stack development skills. 

From crwaling target websites to injecting payloads and identifying flaws, this tool is a practical demonstration of how modern web vulnerabilites like XSS and SQL Injection can be detected. It's designed not only to scan but also to **educate**, with a clear interface and PDF reporting to document everything in a neat format.

## Behind the Build 

The idea was simple: build a scanner that can visit a URL, explore the forms it contains, and test them with crafted payloads to identify security loopholes. As a cybersecurity enthusiast and a learner, I put together the core logic for crawling, scanning, and exporting. The tool is powered by 'BeautifulSoup', 'requests', and 'Flask', with a frontend that updates the user with a timer, countdown, and progress bar while the scan is happening.

## Key Highlights 

- Scans for **XSS** and **SQL Injection** vulnerabilites in forms 
- Automatically crawls and logs input fields 
- Displays results directly in the brower (with bullet points)
- Wraps up everything into a downloadable **PDF report** 
- Timer + countdown + progress bar a smooth user experience 
- Clean, structured codebase and easy-to-navigate UI

## How to Run It

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/sunnysingania7/project01.git
cd project01/web-vuln-scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python app.py 
``` 

Then visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser and start scanning.

## Internship Reflection 

This project was a major part of my internship submission. All scanning logic, payload handling, and security flow design were develop independently by me. From code to concept, I explored how real-world sites can be tested ethically  for vulnerabilities. 

*Special thanks to OpenAI's ChatGPT* - while all logic was written and understood by me, ChatGPT helped stramline some of folder organization, frontend enhancements, and syntax optimizations.
